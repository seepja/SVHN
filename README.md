# SVHN Classification

- The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) is a real-world image dataset used for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms. It is one of the commonly used benchmark datasets as It requires minimal data preprocessing and formatting. It also comes from a significantly harder real world problem of recognising digits and numbers in natural scene images. The images lack any contrast normalisation, contain overlapping digits and distracting features which makes it a much more difficult problem.

- It has been used in neural networks created by Google to read house numbers and match them to their geolocations. This is a great benchmark dataset to play with, learn and train models that accurately identify street numbers, and incorporate into all sorts of projects.

- Full train set + half extra set for training (Could not use full extra set due to RAM limit).

- Keras's image data generator used for more training images.

- Typical CNN architecture.
